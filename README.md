Resource Hacker is a file/resource editing tool on Windows developed by Angus John, which has more than 20 years of history. It was initially released in December 1999 and has been continuously updated throughout the years. This resource editor has a graphical user interface (GUI) that can help users easily view the internal resource of an executable program (.exe) or resource file (.res)[^3] in an intuitive and organized structure.

## Functionality
### Resource Browsing
After installing the software, we can now explore the functionalities of Resource Hacker. When a file is opened in Resource Hacker, the resource of this file is shown as a well-categorized list. From this list, there are folders with names such as AVI, Cursor, Bitmap, Icon, Menu, Dialog, and so on, which clearly indicate the content of the resource folder, helping users find the resource they want conveniently. After viewing the resource, users are able to save its content in different format for further usage.

Use **File >> Open** on the menu bar to select a target resource (ex. *.exe) to open in this editor.:

Then the resource will be displayed as a list of folders in the left panel:

Click on "Save As" button to save a selected component of the current resource to local:

### Software Optimization
Software optimization includes customization of software icon, cursor, bitmap, and other personalizable features. Users can also delete unused or useless resource from the target software to effectively reduce its memory usage. Contrary to that, users can add extra resources to the target software to expand its functionality range. Use the DropDown Menu via **Action** to modify or save resource component conveniently:
